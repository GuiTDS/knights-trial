# üéÆ Knight's Trial

## üìù Project Overview
This game was developed as part of the curriculum for the Game Development course at the **Federal University of Technology ‚Äì Paran√° (UTFPR)**. The project aims to demonstrate practical application of game development concepts learned during the course.

## üöÄ Game Concept
This game features a single, large platforming level where the player navigates through different challenges, including platforming sections and combat encounters. The player faces enemies that attack both in melee and from a distance. Additionally, at certain intervals, a powerful enemy appears to challenge the player.  

The gameplay is focused on platforming mechanics. The player moves using the **WASD** keys and attacks using the **J** key. Throughout the level, the player can collect health potions to recover life. The player has a total of five hearts representing their health, which decreases when taking damage from enemies or hazards.
